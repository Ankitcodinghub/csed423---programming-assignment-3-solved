For this assignment, you will implement a semantic analyzer for Cool. You will use the abstract syntax trees (AST) built by the parser to check that the program conforms to the Cool specification. Your static semantic analyzer should reject erroneous programs; for correct programs, it must gather certain information for use by the code generator. The output of the semantic analyzer will be an annotated AST which is input to the code generator.

This assignment has much more room for design decisions than previous assignments. Your program is correct if it checks programs against the specification. There is no one ‚Äúright‚Äù way to do the assignment, but there are wrong ways. High-level ideas and design principles were covered in classes. There are a number of standard practices that are adopted by compilers in use today, and we will try to convey them to you in this handout. However, what you do is largely up to you.

You will need to refer to the typing rules, identifier scoping rules, and other restrictions of Cool as defined in the Cool Reference manual. You will also need to add methods and data members to the AST class definitions for this phase. The functions the tree package provides are documented in the Tour of Cool Support Code.

There is a lot of information in this handout, and you need to know most of it to write a working semantic analyzer. Please read the handout thoroughly. At a high level, your semantic analyzer will have to perform the following major tasks:

1. Look at all classes and build an inheritance graph.

2. Check that the graph is well-formed.

3. For each class

(a) Traverse the AST, gathering all visible declarations in a symbol table.

(b) Check each expression for type correctness.

(c) Annotate the AST with types.

This list of tasks is not exhaustive; it is up to you to faithfully implement the specification in the manual.

1 Files and Directories

To get started, download and unpack the pa3 directory from the course website. This directory contains all the files that you will need for this PA. The files you will need to modify are:

‚Ä¢ cool-tree.h

This file is where user-defined extensions to the AST nodes are placed. You will likely need to add additional declarations, but do not modify the existing declarations.

‚Ä¢ semant.cc

The semantic analyzer is invoked by calling method semant() of class program class. The class declaration for program class is in cool-tree.h. Any method declarations you add to cool-tree.h should be implemented in this file.

‚Ä¢ semant.h

This file is the header file for semant.cc. You add any additional declarations you need (not in cool-tree.h) here.

‚Ä¢ testgood.cl and test bad.cl

These files test a few semantic features. You would want to add more codes here to ensure that test good.cl exercises as many legal semantic combinations as possible and that test bad.cl exercises as many kinds of semantic errors as possible. It is not possible to exercise all possible combinations; you are only responsible for achieving reasonable coverage.

‚Ä¢ README

You should edit this file if you want your semantic analyzer to be scored with any other lexer or parser than the scored versions. In the first line, you can put ‚Äú2‚Äù if you previously submitted a updated cool.flex with your parser and want us to use the version, or ‚Äú3‚Äù if you want us to use the reference lexer (no deduction for this assignment). In the second line, you can put ‚Äú2‚Äù if you have updated cool.y after submission and want us to use the version, or ‚Äú3‚Äù if you want us to use the reference parser (10% automatic deduction from your score for the semantic analyzer in this case).

To build the semantic analyzer, type

make or make semant

in the directory pa3/src. This will link more files of support code to your directory and compile your files. Your semantic analyzer needs as input the output of your completed parser. Use test good.cl or a working Cool program to test your skeleton parser by typing

lexer test good.cl | parser | semant

2 Tree Traversal

As a result of Programming Assignment 2, your parser builds abstract syntax tress. The method dump with types, defined on most AST nodes, illustrates how to traverse the AST and gather information from it. This algorithmic style ‚Äì a recursive traversal of a complex tree structure ‚Äì is very important, because it is a very natural way to structure many computations on ASTs.

Your programming task for this assignment is to (1) traverse the tree, (2) manage various pieces of information that you obtain from the tree, and (3) use that information to enforce the semantics of Cool. One traversal of the AST is called a ‚Äúpass‚Äù. You will probably need to make at least two passes over the AST to check everything.

3 Inheritance

Inheritance relationships specify a directed graph of class dependencies. A typical requirement of most languages with inheritance is that the inheritance graph be acyclic. It is up to your semantic checker to enforce this requirement. One fairly easy way to do this is to construct a representation of the type graph and then check for cycles.

In addition, Cool has restrictions on inheriting from the basic class (see the manual). It is also an error if class A inherits from class B but class B is not defined.

The project skeleton includes appropriate definitions of all the basic classes. You will need to incorporate these classes into the inheritance hierarchy.

We suggest that you divide your semantic analysis phase into two smaller components. First, check that the inheritance graph is well-defined, meaning that all the restrictions on inheritance are satisfied. If the inheritance graph is not well-defined, it is acceptable to abort compilation (after printing appropriate error messages, of course!). Second, check all the other semantic conditions. It is much easier to implement this second component if one knows the inheritance graph and that it is legal.

4 Naming and Scoping

A major portion of any semantic checker is the management of names. The specific problem is determining which declaration is in effect for each use of an identifier, especially when names can be reused. For example, if i is declared in two let expressions, one nested within the other, then wherever i is referenced the semantics of the language specify which declaration is in effect. It is the job of the semantic checker to keep track of which declaration a name refers to.

Besides the identifier self, which is implicitly bound in every class, there are four ways that an object name can be introduced in Cool:

1. attribute definition

2. formal parameters of methods

3. let expressions

4. branches of case statements

In addition to object names, there are also method names and class names. It is an error to use any name that has no matching declaration. In this case, however, the semantic analyzer should not abort compilation after discovering such an error. Remember that neither classes, methods, nor attributes need be declared before use. Think about how this affects your analysis.

5 Type Checking

One difficult issue is what to do if an expression doesn‚Äôt have a valid type according to the rules. First, an error message should be printed with the line number and a description of what went wrong. It is relatively easy to give informative error messages in the semantic analysis phase, because it is generally obvious what the error is. We expect you to give informative error messages. Second, the semantic analyzer should attempt to recover and continue. We do expect your semantic analyzer to recover, but we do not expect it to avoid cascading errors. A simple recovery mechanism is to assign the type Object to any expression that cannot otherwise be given a type.

6 Code Generator Interface

7 Semantic Analyzer Output

For incorrect programs, the output of semantic analysis is error messages. You are expected to recover from all errors except for ill-formed class hierarchies. You are also expected to produce complete and informative errors. Assuming the inheritance hierarchy is well-formed, the semantic checker should catch and report all semantic errors in the program. Your error messages need not be identical to those of the reference compiler.

We have supplied you with a simple error reporting method:

ostream&amp; ClassTable::semant error(Class )

This routine takes a Class node and returns an output stream that you can use to write error messages. Since the parser ensures that Class nodes store the file in which the class was defined (recall that class definitions cannot be split across files), the line number of the error message can be obtained from the AST node where the error is detected and the filename from the enclosing class.

For correct programs, the output is a type-annotated abstract syntax tree. You will be graded on whether your semantic phase correctly annotates ASTs with types and on whether your semantic phase work correctly with the reference code generator.

8 Testing the Semantic Analyzer

9 Notes

The semantic analyzer is by far the largest component of the compiler so far. The reference solution is approximately 1,300 lines of well-commented C++. You will find the assignment easier if you take some time to design the semantic analyzer prior to coding. Ask yourself the following:

1. What requirements do I need to check?

2. When do I need to check a requirement?

3. When is the information needed to check a requirement generated?

4. Where is the information I need to check a requirement?

If you can answer these questions for each aspect of Cool, implementing a solution should be straightforward.

10 What and How to Turn In

You have to turn in the pa3 directory with your modified version of cool-tree.h (and/or coo-tree.handcode.h), textitsemant.h, semant.cc, test good.cl, and test bad.cl (and README optionally) after compressing it with

tar -cvf pa3 [your student id].tar pa3

Make sure all your code for the semantic analyzer is in cool-tree.h (and/or coo-tree.handcode.h), semant.h, and semant.cc. You can upload the compressed file to the board for assignment submission at the course website. Please do not copy or modify any part of the support code. The provided files are the ones that will be used in the grading process.
